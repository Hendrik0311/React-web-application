Starting the app:

npm install
npm start

You will be taken to the home page.

After that click on register top left, there is validation on the email to make it that you require a @ sign followed by a .

when submit is clicked on you are taken to the login screen where a user can login.

after login you will be able to see your name in the top left

navigating to the products screen, after you click on the product you would like to add to your cart it will automatically take you to the cart page
from where you can then select how many of the item you would like to buy

you will also be able to select a shipping method from the dropbown box

there is also a help button you can click that will explain to you how the shipping works as well as the rates that you will be charged on each shipping method

Hopefully that is all that needs to be done to complete this task
